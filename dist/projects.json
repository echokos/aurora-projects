Review TOOLS.md entry - is it skill-worthy?\n2. If yes: Use skill-creator to build proper skill\n3. Create SKILL.md with:\n   - Credential locations (1Password paths)\n   - Common operations with examples\n   - Scripts/code patterns\n   - Troubleshooting gotchas\n4. Move detailed docs from TOOLS.md to skill references/\n5. Update TOOLS.md with brief summary + link to skill\n6. Package and test the skill\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Stop rediscovering API endpoints and auth patterns\n- Preserve working code examples\n- Faster execution on repeat tasks\n- Better onboarding for new contexts (sub-agents, fresh sessions)\n\n**Success Criteria:**\n- TOOLS.md becomes lean index with pointers to skills\n- Complex workflows documented once, used many times\n- Reduced \"how do I do X again?\" moments\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Review TOOLS.md and identify 3-5 top candidates\n2. Create skills in priority order (most-used first)\n3. Update TOOLS.md to reference new skills\n4.
