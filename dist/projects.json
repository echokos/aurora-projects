      "details": "**Goal:** Fix infinite scroll, reduce data load (esp. mobile)\n\n**Specific Issues:**\n- Scrolling doesn't allow the user to scroll through longer lists of details, as reported by Elliott\n- Implement fix for scrolling and make sure that a user can see all the contents. This means that content from lower screen can be access and usable.\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\nMake updates to the html for scroll and overflow management. What\'s left before it can be closed?\n\n**Definition of Done**:\n* Elliott must be able to access all aspects of the board via scrolling AND adding new cards, also being able to manipulate all parts of the board!",
