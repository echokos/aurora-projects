Set up Google Calendar API integration for assist@majorimpact.com\n2. Create recurring events for scheduled tasks\n3. Build function to log completed work as events\n4. Add calendar blocks for future project work\n5. Dashboard widget showing Aurora's current/upcoming work?\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Decide: use assist@majorimpact.com or create separate calendar?\n- Build calendar event creation function\n- Add automatic logging for recurring tasks\n- Manual logging function for ad-hoc work",

Gateway restarts should be announced before executing\n3. Document upgrade process thoroughly\n4. Test upgrade mechanism - it works correctly\n\n**Emotional Impact:**\nElliott was genuinely scared.

Review TOOLS.md entry - is it skill-worthy?\n2. If yes: Use skill-creator to build proper skill\n3. Create SKILL.md with:\n   - Credential locations (1Password paths)\n   - Common operations with examples\n   - Scripts/code patterns\n   - Troubleshooting gotchas\n4. Move detailed docs from TOOLS.md to skill references/\n5. Update TOOLS.md with brief summary + link to skill\n6.

Review TOOLS.md and identify 3-5 top candidates\n2. Create skills in priority order (most-used first)\n3. Update TOOLS.md to reference new skills\n4.
