Gateway restarts should be announced before executing\n3. Document upgrade process thoroughly\n4. Test upgrade mechanism - it works correctly\n\n**Emotional Impact:**\nElliott was genuinely scared. This matters more than technical success.\n\n**Current Software:** clawdbot 2026.1.24-3 (stable/latest)",
