      "details": "**Goal:** Aurora works autonomously, produces completed work overnight.\n\n**Key Insight (Jan 31):**\nHeartbeat timing is unreliable for precise scheduling. Board review needs to happen BEFORE action crons fire.\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Prep cron runs 5-10 min before action crons (board review, spawn agents)\n- Action crons execute scheduled work\n- Heartbeat for background checks only (email, calendar, etc.)\n\n**User Stories:**\n1. As Aurora, I check the board 5 min before action crons\n2. As Aurora, I delegate appropriate tasks to sub-agents\n3. As Aurora, I produce deliverables without being asked\n4. As Elliott, I wake up to completed work\n\n**Definition of Done:**\n1. Prep cron created (runs 5 min before action crons)\n2. Board items have clear definitions of done\n3. Aurora demonstrates autonomous task completion over 3+ days\n4. Morning deliverables appear without prompting",
